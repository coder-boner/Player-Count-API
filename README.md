The Python was made by Walter

--------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT

### This will run on port 8080 by default so make sure to change it in the bottom of API_server.py

### In the html and python code you will need to locate and change the API urls

### Do not change the name of the folder named "templates" as it will break the webpage
